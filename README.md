## Linux Overview

## What is Open Source?
Open source refers to software that makes its source code available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This collaborative approach promotes innovation, transparency, and community involvement.

## Why Linux?
Linux is an open-source operating system renowned for its stability, security, and flexibility. It's used globally in diverse environments, from servers and supercomputers to smartphones and personal computers. Its open nature allows users to customize and optimize their systems according to their needs.

## How Does Linux Work?
Linux operates through a kernel, which is the core part of the operating system responsible for managing hardware and system resources. It features a modular design, meaning you can configure and tailor your system extensively. The ultimate aim is to deliver a robust, adaptable, and efficient computing experience.
